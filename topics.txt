Hi 
could you pls explain to me about bandit lvl 13 
WebVisitor68124
first try then ask 
this is not hard 
WebVisitor96015
I've already solved it 
it's just i have a doubt 
WebVisitor68124
all bandit is only about linux using on semi-advanced level 
so tell me your doubt 
you have doubt tell me I will answer elaborate 
WebVisitor96015
Why do i have to use localhost in ssh conection instead of the real host (bandit.labs.overthewire.org) 
WebVisitor68124
I don't believe in Wishnu who knows you are from India and come to you in body of avatar to help you knowing what is your problem WAKE UP 
ok, what is your knowledge about DNS 
and routing? 
WebVisitor96015
i've setted a apache server before 
WebVisitor68124
how advanced are you in TCP/ID 
it is apt-get install apache ; systemctl restart apache.service??? 
it's not set up 
and no, apache have nothing to do with DNS nor routing nor SSH 
as you should know if you already make your hands dirty with working with it 
Apache use which port? hmm? 
which use dns queries i.e. from your browser? 
and which ssh 
how resolvhost works? 
this is question you should put straght into google and read read read read read 
WebVisitor96015
I think a know the basis of dns 
WebVisitor68124
but TL;DR, services listen on ports, interfaces and loop back kernel interface is resolved this host by localhost and 127.0.0.0/24 or even 127.0.0.0/16 
soo you know that you have IP and remote have one 
WebVisitor96015
yes 
WebVisitor68124
and service are listening on specific ports which is just sockets on one of OSI layers 
and know that packet is going to them 
so if you know that all I don't understand why you don't know that bandit.overthewire.org is not resolved from themselves 
try to resolve and see that it cant 
if you think it cant 
read about it in man ssh 
and turn -vvv to have verbosity from ssh 
then you will understand... 
and if I helped elaborate in channel that it's done 
next time register the nick and become one of us 
are you understand everything what I said? 
WebVisitor96015
not everything 
but i think i got the idea 
WebVisitor68124
great 
WebVisitor96015
i'm gonna search about it 
thanks! 
WebVisitor68124
best copy this log 
and make notes of it 
if you register that will be better for you 
not bother about somebody blame you but always ask question, not yelll like a baby to plz help me whats going on 
because it's not the way you will get anything 
and you find me hypocrite about that I webvisitor but it's funny when I help webvisitors from that 
you feel less comfortable bc I could be better than you think i.e. infiltrate your browser or sth 
do you scary? good 
now stop, and next time, go with strings attached, register and ask for help properly 
with some contexts and so on 
not like a baby girl/boy 
I find you could be boy bc info sec girls are more concrete 
WebVisitor96015
idk what u mean with that last one 
is there any information in my profile? 
WebVisitor68124
idk why you think sb care when you write this: "could you pls explain to me about bandit lvl 13 " 
but I care 
bye
